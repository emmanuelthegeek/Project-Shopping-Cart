## What was developed

In this project, we made a dynamic **shopping cart**! Consuming data directly from an **API!**. From the acronym _application programming interface_, an API is a point of contact on the Internet with a certain service. Through ** HTTP requests ** to this API it is possible to interact with it as the one who created it planned. Here, we used the 'Mercado Livre' API to seek products for sale.
